| *We present the* ``SimBIG`` *framework and apply it to analyze the power spectrum of SDSS-III: BOSS CMASS galaxies.  We demonstrate that we can rigorously analyze galaxy clustering down to non-scales (k=0.5 h/Mpc) and extract additional cosmological information beyondc current standard anlayses.*

| *We present the mock challenge used to validate the* ``SimBIG`` *framework.  The mock challenge consists of 1,500 test simulations constructed using forward models with different N-body simulation, halo finder, and galaxy-halo connection. With these simulations, we rigorously validate the accuarcy and precision of the posteriors inferred from* ``SimBIG``
